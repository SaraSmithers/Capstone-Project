# Python Projects

The purpose of this repository to hold a variety practice and passion projects that I've completed during my Python learning journey.

* **TOB_XML_GrantsGOV_initial_extract_Final**: The goal of the this project to provide a tool that allows users to search for environmental remediation grants funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This project was completed as part of the Opportunity Project led by the US Census Bureau, The White House OSTP, and the US Department of Commerce. This code extracts, cleans and filters available grant data from the Grants.gov website. The intial data can then be uploaded MongoDB, with additional code that can be run daily to check for new grants and updates to grants.
* **Hydropower_energygen_final**: As part of my capstone project at General Assembly, I analyzed U.S. power generation and drought data to evvaluate how have drought conditions impacted hydroelectric power generation in the Southwest United States. The purpose of this code is to clean available hydropower plant source data and perform exploratory data analysis.
